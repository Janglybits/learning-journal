#Document in your journal the different classifications of text editors, and why it’s important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code.

##As far as classifications, it basically breaks down into three main types

1. Barebones text editors. Things along the lines of the basic Notepad application in Windows. These have no functionality outside of entering text.
2. 3rd arty text editors. These usually contain additional features to make your life easier, like syntax highlighting, code completion, and file management.
3. IDEs. IDEs tend to be an all in one solution that contains most of the features of more popular 3rd party text editors, as well as a compiler.

Barebones 1st party text editors could be used in a pinch, but are less efficient than 3rd party editors. IDEs are great, but not necessary if your're only using HTML, CSS, and JS (JS has a just in time compiler).

Record in your journal a “cheat sheet” or other resource for basic terminal usage.

PWD (print working directory). I'm starting with this, because it's the one I forget the most. This displays the full working directory.
Ls (list). Similar to the dir command in MSDOS. Lists directory contents. Can take additional arguments.
CD (I'm assuming it's call directory). Used to navigate into another directory. Can take additional arguments.
