# Read: 01

For Read:01 I decided to take Craig's advice and make a true/false quiz!

## Read: 01 True/False questions
True or false?

1. Text size can be modified in markdown by starting a line with one or more "#" symbols?

2. You can mention a person or team by typing "@" plus their username or team name?

3. You can add emoji to your code by typing ":emoji:"? :smiley_cat:

4. You can create an unordered list by starting each line with "-"?
