# Introduction, and thoughts on a growth mindset

On the [Atlassian Blog](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset), Steve Haffenden shares his thoughts about a growth mindset in regards to software development. Essentially, that attitude, effort, and learning are more valuable in the long run than just talent and natural intelligence.

### Ways that I think I can apply a growth mindset
1. When I'm stuck, I tend to focus on the solution. While this is beneficial in other aspects of life, while learning I need to also focus on **how** the problem occured.
2. At times (professionally) I can get frustrated by the exectations of non-technical staff. When they ask for a lot, I need to remember that it's because they believe that I can do it.
3. I need to be easier on myself. My first go round with being a developer ended with a crushing case of imposter syndrome. Much like being a musician, being a developer involves lifelong learning and the chase of mastery. There are always new things to learn and get better at.
